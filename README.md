Cyber Spider

Final Project for CS32 - Data Structures and Algorithms

The Cyber Spider project is a basic but efficient program that is capable of
crawling through billions of lines of telemetry data effiiciently in order to
detect threats based on specific criteria for malicious entities. Cyber Spider
can discover all threats in O(N) time. This is done with a disk-based hash
multimap data structure for O(1) read times and a depth-first search style
algorithm that crawls through all the telemetry data and analyzing the
relationships present in the data.

Project 4 folder contains my code for the data structure and corresponding
algorithms. The other folders were supplied by my course for testing purposes.

More specific specifications as well as the criteria for malicious entities can
be found at http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter16/cs32/Projects/4/spec.html
